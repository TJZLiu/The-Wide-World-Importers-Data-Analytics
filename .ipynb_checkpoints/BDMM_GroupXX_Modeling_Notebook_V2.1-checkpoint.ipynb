    "Even though business is thriving, the IT department is going through a bad time.   <br>\n",

    "\n",
    "WWI data are spread accross different systems, but we've already managed to pull them all into a mongo dump file. This data file is an exact dump of the SQL data so includes all the same structure, the SQL tables become collections and the rows become documents. This means all the original SQL keys are included in the data.<br>\n",
    "Currently, the costs to develop the necessary queries to collect data to answer questions asked by the different departments are too high. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Management concluded it is the right time to revise and revamp the data architecture, in order to speed up operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "In that context, your team was tasked with merging all the company data into a single and coherent Mongo database. <br>\n",
    "It is expected that, with your solution, WWI will have a better understanding of their business and that the different departments will be able to obtain efficiently the answers they need.\n",
